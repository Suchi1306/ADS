Gujarat lies 300400 km from the plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate but the current tectonics are still governed by the effects of the continuing continental collision along this boundary During the breakup of Gondwana in the Jurassic this area was affected by rifting with a roughly westeast trend During the collision with Eurasia the area has undergone shortening involving both reactivation of the original rift faults and development of new lowangle thrust faults The related folding has formed a series of ranges particularly in central KutchThe focal mechanism of most earthquakes is consistent with reverse faulting on reactivated rift faults The pattern of uplift and subsidence associated with the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake is consistent with reactivation of such a fault

China claims that the Kuomintang government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and that a Kuomintang representative General Wu Zhongxin presided over the ceremony The British Representative Sir Basil Gould was also at the ceremony and bore witness to the falsity of the Chinese claim to have presided over it He criticised the Chinese account as follows

The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude Every one of these Chinese claims was false Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf as was done by the others including the British Representative But the Chinese have the ear of the world and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue Tibet has no newspapers either in English or Tibetan and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods

In Dalai Lamas essay The Ethic of Compassion 1999 he expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with which cannot allow us to cultivate love He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strengthHe frequently accepts requests from students to visit various countries worldwide in order to give teachings to large Buddhist audiences teachings that are usually based on classical Buddhist texts and commentaries and most often those written by the 17 pandits or great masters of the Nalanda tradition such as Nagarjuna Kamalashila Shantideva Atisha Ayradeva and so on

The Dalai Lama refers to himself as a follower of these Nalanda masters in fact he often asserts that Tibetan Buddhism is based on the Buddhist tradition of Nalanda monastery in ancient India since the texts written by those 17 Nalanda pandits or masters to whom he has composed a poem of invocation were brought to Tibet and translated into Tibetan when Buddhism was first established there and have remained central to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism ever sinceAs examples of other teachings in London in 1984 he was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising and on Dzogchen which he gave at Camden Town Hall in 1988 he was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general called A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism Again in London in 1996 he taught the Four Noble Truths the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UKIn India the Dalai Lama gives religious teachings and talks in Dharamsala and numerous other locations including the monasteries in the Tibetan refugee settlements in response to specific requests from Tibetan monastic institutions Indian academic religious and business associations groups of students and individualprivatelay devotees In India no fees are charged to attend these teachings since costs are covered by requesting sponsors When he travels abroad to give teachings there is usually a ticket fee calculated by the inviting organization to cover the costs involved and any surplus is normally to be donated to recognised charitiesOn his frequent tours of India Asia and the west he is also often invited to give alongside his Buddhist teachings public talks for nonBuddhist audiences His talks and teaching activities in the US for example have included the following on his April 2008 US tour he gave lectures at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor at Rutgers University New Jersey and Colgate University New York Later in July the Dalai Lama gave a public lecture and conducted a series of teachings at Lehigh University Pennsylvania On 8 May 2011 the University of Minnesota bestowed upon him their highest award an Honorary Doctor of Letters and during a return trip to Minnesota on 2 March 2014 he spoke at Macalester College which awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degreeDozens of videos of recorded webcasts of the Dalai Lamas public talks on general subjects for nonBuddhists like peace happiness and compassion modern ethics the environment economic and social issues gender the empowerment of women and so forth can be viewed in his offices archive

The events in Gujarat were the first instance of communal violence in India in the age of 24hour news coverage and were televised worldwide This coverage played a central role in the politics of the situation Media coverage was generally critical of the Hindu right however the BJP portrayed the coverage as an assault on the honor of Gujaratis and turned the hostility into an emotive part of their electoral campaign With the violence receding in April a peace meeting was arranged at Sabarmati Ashram a former home of Mahatma Gandhi Hindutva supporters and police officers attacked almost a dozen journalists The state government banned television news channels critical of the governments response and local stations were blocked Two reporters working for STAR News were assaulted several times while covering the violence On a return trip from having interviewed Modi when their car was surrounded by a crowd one of the crowd claimed that they would be killed should they be a member of a minority community

Many scholars and commentators have accused the state government of being complicit in the attacks either in failing to exert any effort to quell the violence or for actively planning and executing the attacks themselves The United States Department of State ultimately banned Narendra Modi from travelling to the United States due to his alleged role in the attacks These allegations center around several facts First the state did little to quell the violence with attacks continuing well through the Spring  Further some attackers used voter lists and other documents obtainable only with government assistance in order to target Muslim communities and households  Moreover the Vishva Hindu Parishad VHP as well as many politicians including Modi made inflammatory remarks and endorsed the statewide bandh further stoking tensions The historian Gyanendra Pandey described these attacks as state terrorism saying that they were not riots but organized political massacres According to Paul Brass the only conclusion from the evidence which is available points to a methodical AntiMuslim pogrom which was carried out with exceptional brutality coordinationThe media has described the attacks as state terrorism rather than communal riots due to the lack of state intervention  Many politicians downplayed the incidents claiming that the situation was under control  One minister who spoke with Rediffcom stated that though the circumstances were tense in Baroda and Ahmedabad the situation was under control and that the police who had been deployed were enough to prevent any violence The deputy superintendent of police stated that the Rapid Action Force had been deployed to sensitive areas in Godhra Gordhan Zadafia the Minister of State for Home stated that he believed there would be no retaliation from the Hindu community Once troops were airlifted in on 1 March Modi stated that the violence was no longer as intense as it had been and that it would soon be brought under control The violence continued for 3 months with no intervention from the federal government till May Local and statelevel politicians were seen leading violent mobs restraining the police and arranging the distribution of weapons leading investigative reports to conclude that the violence was engineered and launchedThroughout the violence attacks were made in full view of police stations and police officers who did not intervene In many instances police joined the mobs in perpetrating violence At one Muslim locality of the twentynine deaths sixteen were caused by police firing into the locality Some rioters even had printouts of voter registration lists allowing them to selectively target Muslim properties Selective targeting of properties was shown by the destruction of the offices of the Muslim Wakf board which was located within the confines of the high security zone and just 500 meters from the office of the chief ministerAccording to Scott W Hibbard the violence had been planned far in advance and that similar to other instances of communal violence the Bajrang Dal the VHP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS all took part in the attacks Following the attack on the train the VHP called for a statewide bandh strike and the state took no action to prevent thisThe Concerned Citizens Tribunal CCT report includes testimony of the then Gujarat BJP minister Haren Pandya since murdered who testified about an evening meeting convened by Modi the evening of the train burning At this meeting officials were instructed not to obstruct the Hindu rage following the incident The report also highlighted a second meeting held in Lunawada village of Panchmahal district attended by state ministers Ashok Bhatt and Prabhatsinh Chauhan among other BJP and RSS leaders where detailed plans were made on the use of kerosene and petrol for arson and other methods of killing The Jamiat UlamaiHind claimed in 2002 that some regional Congress workers collaborated with the perpetrators of the violenceDipankar Gupta believes that the state and police were clearly complicit in the violence but that some officers were outstanding in the performance of their duties such as Himanshu Bhatt and Rahul Sharma Sharma was reported to have said I dont think any other job would have allowed me to save so many lives  Human Rights Watch has reported on acts of exceptional heroism by Hindus Dalits and tribals who tried to protect Muslims from the violenceIn response to allegations of state involvement Gujarat government spokesman Bharat Pandya told the BBC that the rioting was a spontaneous Hindu backlash fueled by widespread anger against Muslims He said Hindus are frustrated over the role of Muslims in the ongoing violence in Indianadministered Kashmir and other parts of India  In support of this the US Ambassador atlarge for International Religious Freedom John Hanford expressed concern over religious intolerance in Indian politics and said that while the rioters may have been aided by state and local officials he did not believe that the BJPled central government was involved in inciting the riots

The Dalai Lamas lifelong interest in science and technology dates from his childhood in Lhasa Tibet when he was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks watches telescopes film projectors clockwork soldiers and motor cars and loved to repair disassemble and reassemble them Once observing the moon through a telescope as a child he realised it was a craterpocked lump of rock and not a heavenly body emitting its own light as Tibetan cosmologists had taught him He has also said that had he not been brought up as a monk he would probably have been an engineer On his first trip to the west in 1973 he asked to visit Cambridge Universitys astrophysics department in the UK and he sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper David Bohm and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who taught him the basics of science

The Dalai Lama sees important common ground between science and Buddhism in having the same approach to challenge dogma on the basis of empirical evidence that comes from observation and analysis of phenomenaHis growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the Buddhism and science interface led to invitations for him to attend relevant conferences on his visits to the west including the Alpbach Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where he met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J Varela Also in 1983 the American social entrepreneur and innovator R Adam Engle who had become aware of the Dalai Lamas deep interest in science was already considering the idea of facilitating for him a serious dialogue with a selection of appropriate scientists In 1984 Engle formally offered to the Dalai Lamas office to organise a weeklong formal dialogue for him with a suitable team of scientists provided that the Dalai Lama would wish to fully participate in such a dialogue Within 48 hours the Dalai Lama confirmed to Engle that he was truly interested in participating in something substantial about science so Engle proceeded with launching the project Francisco Varela having heard about Engles proposal then called him to tell him of his earlier discussions with the Dalai Lama and to offer his scientific collaboration to the project Engle accepted and Varela assisted him to assemble his team of six specialist scientists for the first Mind and Life dialogue on the cognitive sciences which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987 This fiveday event was so successful that at the end the Dalai Lama told Engle he would very much like to repeat it again in the future Engle then started work on arranging a second dialogue this time with neuroscientists in California and the discussions from the first event were edited and published as Mind and Lifes first book Gentle Bridges Conversations with the Dalai Lama on the Sciences of MindAs Mind and Life Institutes remit expanded Engle formalised the organisation as a nonprofit foundation after the third dialogue held in 1990 which initiated the undertaking of neurobiological research programmes in the United States under scientific conditions Over the ensuing decades as of 2014 at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various worldrenowned scientists have followed held in various countries and covering diverse themes from the nature of consciousness to cosmology and from quantum mechanics to the neuroplasticity of the brain Sponsors and partners in these dialogues have included the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Johns Hopkins University the Mayo Clinic and Zurich UniversityApart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers the Dalai Lama has probably spent and continues to spend more of his time and resources investigating the interface between Buddhism and science through the ongoing series of Mind and Life dialogues and its spinoffs than on any other single activity As the Institutes Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues which continue to expand worldwideThese activities have given rise to dozens of DVD sets of the dialogues and books he has authored on them such as Ethics for the New Millennium and The Universe in a Single Atom as well as scientific papers and university research programmes On the Tibetan and Buddhist side science subjects have been added to the curriculum for Tibetan monastic educational institutions and scholarship On the Western side university and research programmes initiated by these dialogues and funded with millions of dollars in grants from the Dalai Lama Trust include the EmoryTibet Partnership Stanford School of Medicines Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education CCARES and the Centre for Investigating Healthy Minds amongst others

Of all the modern economic theories the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability Marxism is concerned with the distribution of wealth on an equal basis and the equitable utilisation of the means of production It is also concerned with the fate of the working classesthat is the majorityas well as with the fate of those who are underprivileged and in need and Marxism cares about the victims of minorityimposed exploitation For those reasons the system appeals to me and it seems fair I just recently read an article in a paper where His Holiness the Pope also pointed out some positive aspects of Marxism

A monk since childhood the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later while chastity offers a better life and more independence more freedom He has observed that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adulteryIn his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior he explains the concept of right organ in the right object at the right time which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral manual and anal sex both homosexual and heterosexual are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists However he also says that in modern times all common consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are gay or transgender from a secular point of view In a 1994 interview with OUT Magazine the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying If someone comes to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not I will ask What is your companions opinion If you both agree then I think I would say If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others then it is okay However when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor Evan Solomon on CBC News Sunday about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism the Dalai Lama responded that it is sexual misconduct This was an echo of an earlier response in a 2004 The Vancouver Sun interview when asked about homosexuality in Buddhism where the Dalai Lama replied for a Buddhist the same sex that is sexual misconductIn his 1996 book Beyond Dogma he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else     Homosexuality whether it is between men or between women is not improper in itself What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact He elaborated in 1997 explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him He also conveyed his own willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic contextThe Dalai Lama has expressed concern at reports of violence and discrimination against gay bisexual and transgender people and urges respect tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all

Newspaper clippings about  14th Dalai Lama in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBWThe 1828 United States presidential election was the 11th quadrennial presidential election held from October 31 to December 2 1828 It featured a rematch of the 1824 election as President John Quincy Adams of the National Republican Party faced Andrew Jackson of the Democratic Party Both parties were new organizations and this was the first Presidential election their nominees contested Unlike in 1824 Jackson defeated Adams marking the start of Democratic dominance in Federal politics

In 1824 with four major candidates running for President as members of only one national party Jackson had won a plurality both of the electoral vote and of the popular vote from among the 18 states whose voters chose Presidential electors  However with the open support of House Speaker Henry Clay Adams won the subsequent contingent election in the House of Representatives under the Twelfth Amendment  Many Jackson supporters perceived that his loss though Constitutional was unfair and contrary to the popular will accusing Adams and Clay of having reached a corrupt bargain in which Clay helped Adams win the contingent election in return for the position of Secretary of State Intensifying political rivalry between supporters and opponents of Jackson fractured the oncedominant DemocraticRepublican Party Jackson and allies such as Martin Van Buren and Vice President John C Calhoun laid the foundations of the Democratic Party while supporters of Adams and other Jackson opponents rallied around the President calling themselves National Republicans

By popular pressure states had recently expanded voting rights to nearly all white men in nearly all elections For example in 1824 state legislatures chose Presidential electors in six states but by 1828 four had transitioned to voter choice Also while nationally organized parties had fielded rival candidates before 1828 was the first election in which broadly qualified voters effectively chose the President from between nominees of two national parties whose candidates or electors consistently appeared on all ballots With greater perceived and real impact voter participation grew with 95 of Americans casting a vote for President compared with 34 in 1824Jackson was aided by the passage of the Tariff of 1828 which raised tariffs Denounced by opponents as the Tariff of Abominations the unpopular tariff and the greater charisma and popular appeal of Jackson helped him dominate the South and West Adams swept New England but won only three other small states Jackson became the first President whose home state was neither Massachusetts nor Virginia while Adams was the second to lose reelection following his father John Adams The election marked the rise of Jacksonian Democracy and the transition from the First Party System to the Second Party System Historians debate the significance of the election with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics by removing key barriers to voter participation and establishing a stable twoparty system

Andrew Jackson won a plurality of electoral votes in the election of 1824 but still lost to John Quincy Adams when the election was deferred to the House of Representatives by the terms of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution a presidential election in which no candidate wins a majority of the electoral vote is decided by the House of Representatives Henry Clay unsuccessful candidate and Speaker of the House at the time despised Jackson in part due to their fight for Western votes during the election and he chose to support Adams which led to Adams being elected president A few days after the election Adams named Clay his Secretary of State a position which at that time often led to the presidency Jackson and his followers immediately accused Clay and Adams of striking a corrupt bargain and they continued to lambaste the president until the 1828 election

Within months after the inauguration of John Quincy Adams in 1825 the Tennessee legislature renominated Jackson for president thus setting the stage for a rematch between these two very different politicians three years thence Congressional opponents of Adams including former William H Crawford supporter Martin Van Buren rallied around Jacksons candidacy Jacksons supporters called themselves Democrats and would formally organize as the Democratic Party shortly after his election In hopes of uniting those opposed to Adams Jackson ran on a ticket with sitting Vice President John C Calhoun Calhoun would decline the invitation to join the Democratic Party however and instead formed the Nullifier Party after the election the Nullifiers would remain largely aligned with the Democrats for the next few years but ultimately broke with Jackson over the issue of states rights during his first term No congressional nominating caucus or national convention was held

The campaign was marked by large amounts of nasty mudslinging Jacksons marriage for example came in for vicious attack When Jackson married his wife Rachel in 1791 the couple believed that she was divorced however the divorce was not yet finalized so he had to remarry her once the legal papers were complete In the Adams campaigns hands this became a scandal Charles Hammond in his Cincinnati Gazette asked Ought a convicted adulteress and her paramour husband be placed in the highest offices of this free and Christian land Jackson also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards of morality he was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work The Coffin Handbills attacked Jackson for his courtsmartial execution of deserters and massacres of Indian villages and also his habit of dueling
==========
==========
==========
Jackson avoided articulating issue positions instead campaigning on his personal qualities and his opposition to Adams Adams avoided popular campaigning instead emphasizing his support of specific issues Adamss praise of internal improvements in Europe such as lighthouses of the skies observatories in his first annual message to Congress and his suggestion that Congress not be palsied by the will of our constituents were given attention in and out of the press John Randolph stated on the floor of the Senate that he never will be palsied by any power save the constitution and the will of my constituents Jackson wrote that a lavish government combined with contempt of the constituents could lead to despotism if not checked by the voice of the people

Modern campaigning was also introduced by Jackson People kissed babies had picnics and started many other traditions during the campaign

Though prepoll predictions were for an overwhelming majority for the BJP the exit polls immediately after the elections and before the counting began predicted a hung parliament However even the exit polls could only indicate the general trend and nowhere close to the final figures There is also the general perception that as soon as the BJP started realising that events might not proceed entirely in its favour it changed the focus of its campaign from India Shining to issues of stability The Congress who was regarded as oldfashioned by the ruling BJP was largely backed by poor rural lowercaste and minority voters that did not participate in the economic boom of previous years that created a large wealthy middle class and thus achieved its overwhelming victory Another reason which was not mentioned much but still spoken of in the public was that BJP supporters are workingclass people and the poll surveys predicted BJP win and therefore they did not reach the ballot Whereas the Congress support base the weaker sections of the society dont miss voting at allAnother more prominent reason came from checking the RSS contribution RSS cadres reached Vajpayee over the killing of 4 RSS workers in Assam and Vajpayee disappointed them RSS backed off and results were evident

Thomas Jefferson wrote favorably in response to Jackson in December 1823 and extended an invitation to his estate of Monticello I recall with pleasure the remembrance of our joint labors while in the Senate together in times of great trial and of hard battling battles indeed of words not of blood as those you have since fought so much for your own glory  that of your country with the assurance that my attempts continue undiminished accept that of my great respect  considerationJefferson wrote in dismay at the outcome of the contingent election of 1825 to Congressional caucus nominee William H Crawford saying that he had hoped to congratulate Crawford but events had not been what we had wishedIn the next election Jacksons and Adamss supporters saw value in establishing the opinion of Jefferson in regards to their respective candidates and against their opposition Jefferson died on July 4 1826
==========
It is also believed that voters regardless of which country they are in are enthused by negative messages and are indifferent to positive messages
==========
A goal of the proAdams press was to depict Jackson as a mere military chieftain Edward Coles recounted that Jefferson told him in a conversation in August 1825 that he feared the popular enthusiasm for Jackson It has caused me to doubt more than anything that has occurred since our Revolution Coles used the opinion of Thomas Gilmer to back himself up Gilmer said Jefferson told him at Monticello before the election of Adams in 1825 One might as well make a sailor of a cock or a soldier of a goose as a President of Andrew Jackson Daniel Webster who was also at Monticello at the time made the same report Webster recorded that Jefferson told him in December 1824 that Jackson was a dangerous man unfit for the presidency Historian Sean Wilentz described Websters account of the meeting as not wholly reliable Biographer Robert V Remini said that Jefferson had no great love for Jackson
==========
It is generally believed that RSS plays an important role in mobilising the BJP supporters the results were not for the win for Congress led UPA but more for the defeat of BJP led NDA And the reason was that RSS did not mobilise the voters and BJP cadres
==========

==========

==========
Gilmer accused Coles of misrepresentation for Jeffersons opinion had changed Gilmer said Jeffersons soninlaw former Virginia Governor Thomas Mann Randolph Jr said in 1826 that Jefferson had a strong repugnance to Henry Clay Randolph publicly stated that Jefferson became friendly to Jacksons candidacy as early as the summer of 1825 perhaps because of the corrupt bargain charge and thought of Jackson as an honest sincere clearheaded and strongminded man of the soundest political principles and the only hope left to reverse the increasing powers assumed by the federal government Others said the same thing but Coles could not believe Jeffersons opinion had changedIn 1827 Virginia Governor William B Giles released a letter from Jefferson meant to be kept private to Thomas Ritchies Richmond Enquirer It was written after Adamss first annual message to Congress and it contained an attack from Jefferson on the incumbent administration Giles said Jeffersons alarm was with the usurpation of the rights of the states not with a military chieftain Jefferson wrote take together the decisions of the federal court the doctrines of the President and the misconstructions of the constitutional compact acted on by the legislature of the federal bench and it is but too evident that the three ruling branches of that department are in combination to strip their colleagues the State authorities of the powers reserved by them and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic Of the Federalists he continued But this opens with a vast accession of strength from their younger recruits who having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of 76 now look to a single and splendid government of an aristocracy founded on banking institutions and moneyed incorporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures commerce and navigation riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry The Jacksonians and states rights men heralded its publication the Adams men felt it a symptom of senility Giles omitted a prior letter of Jeffersons praise of Adams for his role in the embargo of 1808 Thomas Jefferson Randolph soon collected and published Jeffersons correspondence

The convention which was presided over by Governor Robert Lucas hosted delegates from every state except Missouri Jackson won the presidential nomination unanimously With Jacksons strong endorsement Van Buren won the vice presidential nomination by a wide margin defeating former Congressman Philip Pendleton Barbour of Virginia and Congressman Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky The Democratic ticket of Jackson and Van Buren went on to win the 1832 presidential election

In the summer of 1822 Richmond Junto leader Thomas Ritchie of Virginia began raising the idea of a national convention to resolve the issue of nomination ultimately the Congressional nominating caucus was appealed to by the devotees of Treasury Secretary William H Crawfords candidacy Following that defeat in the election of 1824 early in 1827 Van Buren privately made the argument to Richie for an exclusive national convention of Republicans to ensure Jacksons nomination However it did not immediately come to fruition while state conventions and legislatures took up Jackson as their presidential candidate for the election of 1828 with Vice President John C Calhoun as his running mate Such a type of national convention would occur after the election
==========

==========
In 1830 Calhoun had fallen out of President Jacksons favor in part from a letter written by Crawford that stated that Calhoun as Secretary of War under President James Monroe pushed for a reprimand of thenGeneral Jackson for his actions in the 1818 invasion of Florida The Petticoat affair in which Calhouns wife Floride was a central figure further alienated Jackson from the Vice President and his supporters The final blow to the relationship came when Calhoun sank Van Burens nomination as Minister to Great Britain by casting a tiebreaking vote in the United States Senate Calhoun resigned as Vice President on 28 December 1832 seven weeks after the presidential election and became a Senator from South Carolina where he continued to be a proponent of the doctrine of nullification in opposition to Jackson

GentlemenThe proposition for calling a general convention of delegates to act on the nomination of a candidate for president and to select a suitable candidate for vicepresident of the United States originated in the state of New Hampshire by the friends of democracy in that state and it appears that the proposition although opposed by the enemies of the democratic party has found favor in nearly and perhaps all the States of the Union  The object of the representatives of the people of New Hampshire who called this convention was not to impose on the people as candidate for either of the two offices in this government any local favorite but to concentrate the opinion of all the states  They believed that the example of this convention would operate favorably in future elections that the people would be disposed after seeing the good effects of this convention in conciliating the different and distant sections of the country to continue this mode of nomination

On 25 September 2008 Hindustan Times reported that the Crime branch also learnt that the men behind 2008 Delhi bombings are those very operatives who had introduced themselves as Pakistanis to perpetrators of 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombingsJemaah Islamiyah is known to use pressure cooker bombs with RDX and like explosives with taggants  Note that Jemaah Islamiyah had operatives in the Pakistan areas active in religious indoctrination and that were working with Egyptian Islamic Jihad through alZawahiri who taught on the use of pressure cooker bombs  As such it is quite possible that Jemaah Islamiyah was involved in the attack possibly through Indian Mujahideen which it also forms part of  Note that Jemaah Islamiyah was behind the 911 anthrax attacks as well

At the outset of the convention the leading contender was former President Martin Van Buren of New York who had been defeated in the 1840 election His principal opponent was Lewis Cass of Michigan who had served as United States Secretary of War under President Andrew Jackson The annexation of Texas was a major issue Van Buren publicly opposed immediate annexation because it might lead to a sectional crisis over the status of slavery in the West This position cost Van Buren the support of Southern and expansionist Democrats but he believed that backing annexation would cost him the support of his fellow New Yorkers and other NortheasternersVan Burens supporters arrived at the convention with a majority of the delegates pledged to support him on the first ballot Cass meanwhile had support from a handful of Southern states but far fewer delegates pledged to him At the previous convention in 1840 a majority of votes had been sufficient to secure the nomination but this had been a departure from the traditional practice of requiring a twothirds vote to win the nominationEarly in the proceedings Senator Robert J Walker of Mississippi in cooperation with Senator James Buchanan of Pennsylvania who would later become President himself called for the reinstatement of the traditional 1832 and 1835 convention rule requiring the nominee to win twothirds of the votes Following a historical pattern in which a minority faction of Northern Democrats delivered votes to produce southern wing victories for proslavery legislation the Van Burenite delegates split over the pivotal vote Fully onethird of the proVan Buren delegates 52 of 154 voted to reinstate the twothirds rule along with 90 of 104 antiVan Buren delegates producing a final vote of 148 to 116 The rule would remain in place until the 1936 Democratic National Convention when it was revoked by supporters of Franklin D Roosevelt

Incumbent Democratic President Franklin Pierces standing with the public had been badly damaged by Bleeding Kansas the civil strife in Kansas Territory over slavery Many dissatisfied Democrats lined up behind Buchanan who had served as Pierces ambassador to Britain and thus had avoided the controversy over Bleeding Kansas while a smaller group of Democrats supported Senator Stephen A Douglas of Illinois Buchanan led on the first ballot and slowly grew his support on subsequent ballots leading Pierce to instruct his delegates to back Douglas Douglas agreed to withdraw his name after receiving assurances that Buchanan would not seek reelection in 1860 allowing Buchanan to clinch the nomination on the seventeenth ballot Pierce became the first and only elected president who was an active candidate for reelection to be denied his partys nomination for a second term

The Democratic Party was wounded from its devastating losses in the 18541855 midterm elections The party faced continued NorthSouth sectional division over slaveryrelated issues especially the KansasNebraska Act of 1854 and subsequent violence known as Bleeding Kansas from the civil strife in the Kansas Territory during its campaign for statehood Two notable Democratic politicians President Pierce and Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois were seen as being at the center of the controversies which led many party members to look elsewhere for a new compromise candidate for president

James Buchanan had been a candidate for president at the 1852 Democratic National Convention and after the 1852 election he agreed to serve as Pierces ambassador to Britain Buchanans service abroad conveniently placed him outside of the country while the debate over the KansasNebraska Act roiled the nation Powerful Senators like John Slidell Jesse Bright and Thomas F Bayard lined up behind Buchanan presenting him as an experienced leader who could appeal to the North and South While Buchanan did not overtly seek the presidency he most deliberately chose not to discourage the movement on his behalf something that was well within his power on many occasions

Franklin Pierce at HistorycomThe 1860 Democratic National Conventions were a series of presidential nominating conventions held to nominate the Democratic Partys candidates for president and vice president in the 1860 election The first convention held from April 23 to May 3 in Charleston South Carolina failed to nominate a ticket Two subsequent conventions both held in Baltimore Maryland in June nominated two separate presidential tickets
==========

==========
Senator Stephen A Douglas of Illinois entered the Charleston convention as the frontrunner for the presidential nomination and he won a majority on the first presidential ballot of the convention However convention rules required a twothirds majority for nomination and Douglass adherence to the Freeport Doctrine regarding slavery in the territories engendered strong opposition from many Southern delegates Opponents of Douglass nomination spread their support among five major candidates including former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Kentucky and Senator Robert M T Hunter of Virginia After 57 ballots in which Douglas consistently won majority support but failed to cross the twothirds threshold the Charleston convention adjourned
==========

==========
The Democratic convention reconvened in Baltimore on June 18 but many Southern delegates were either excluded from the convention or refused to participate Douglas was nominated for president on the second ballot Senator Benjamin Fitzpatrick of Alabama was nominated for vice president but later refused the nomination he was ultimately replaced by former Governor Herschel Vespasian Johnson of Georgia A group of Southern Democrats met in their own separate convention adopted a proslavery platform and nominated incumbent Vice President John C Breckinridge of Kentucky for president and Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon for vice president Douglas and Breckinridge both went on to win a significant share of the popular vote in the 1860 presidential election but Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won the election

The 1860 Democratic National Convention convened at South Carolina Institute Hall destroyed in the Great Fire of 1861 in Charleston South Carolina on 23 April 1860 Charleston was probably the most proslavery city in the US at the time and the galleries at the convention were packed with proslavery spectatorsThe frontrunner for the nomination was Douglas Douglas was considered a moderate on the slavery issue With the 1854 KansasNebraska Act he advanced the doctrine of popular sovereignty allowing settlers in each Territory to decide for themselves whether slavery would be allowed  a change from the flat prohibition of slavery in most Territories under the Missouri Compromise which the South had welcomed However the Supreme Court’s ensuing 1857 Dred Scott decision declared that the Constitution protected slavery in all Territories
==========

==========
Douglas was challenged for his Senate seat by Abraham Lincoln in 1858 and narrowly won reelection by professing the Freeport Doctrine a de facto rejection of  Dred Scott Now militant Southern FireEaters such as William Yancey of Alabama opposed him as a traitor Many of them openly predicted a split in the party and the election of Republican frontrunner William H SewardUrged by Yancey the delegations from seven Deep South states Georgia Alabama Mississippi Louisiana Arkansas Texas and Florida met in a separate caucus before the convention They reached a tentative consensus to stop Douglas by imposing a proslavery party platform which he could not run on if nominatedThe Fireeater majority on the conventions platform committee chaired by William Waightstill Avery of North Carolina produced an explicitly proslavery document endorsing Dred Scott and Congressional legislation protecting slavery in the territories Northern Democrats refused to acquiesce Dred Scott was extremely unpopular in the North and the Northerners said they could not carry a single state with that platform On 30 April the convention by a vote of 165 to 138 adopted the minority Northern platform which omitted these planks 50 Southern delegates then left the convention in protest including the Alabama Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi South Carolina and Texas delegations three of the four delegates from Arkansas and one of the three delegates from Delaware
==========

==========
The departed delegates gathered at St Andrews Hall on Broad Street declared themselves the real convention and awaited conciliatory action by the Institute Hall convention That didnt happen Instead the Institute Hall convention proceeded to nominations The dominant Douglas forces believed their path was now clearSix major candidates were nominated at the convention  Douglas former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Kentucky Senator Robert M T Hunter of Virginia Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon former Senator Daniel S Dickinson of New York and Senator Andrew Johnson of Tennessee 
==========

==========
Douglas led on the first ballot with 145½ of 253 votes cast However the convention rules required a twothirds vote to approve a nomination Furthermore convention chairman Caleb Cushing ruled that twothirds of the conventions whole membership was required not just twothirds of those actually present and voting
==========

==========
Douglas thus needed 56½ more votes or a total of 202 from the 253 delegates still present The convention held 57 ballots and though Douglas led on all of them he never got more than 152 votes On the 57th ballot Douglas got 151½ votes still 50½ votes short of the nomination though far ahead of Guthrie who was second with 65½ In desperation on 3 May the delegates voted to adjourn the convention and reconvene in Baltimore six weeks later
