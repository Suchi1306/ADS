A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister The state's GDP growth rate averaged 10 during Modi's tenure a value similar to other highly industrialised states and above that of the country as a whole Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s before Modi took office and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure Under Modi Gujarat topped the World Bank's ease of doing business rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years In 2013 Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for economic freedom by a report measuring governance growth citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states In the later years of Modi's government Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states as was land Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones where labour laws were greatly weakenedDespite its growth rate Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development poverty relief nutrition and education during Modi's tenure In 2013 Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished putting the state in the alarming category on the India State Hunger Index A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in childrenOver the decade from 2001 to 2011 Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined With respect to the quality of education in government schools the state ranked below most Indian states The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims Dalits and Adivasis and generally increased social inequalities Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index Under Modi the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare

During the campaign Modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous INC government and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat Modi projected himself as a person who could bring about development without focus on any specific policies His message found support among young Indians and among middleclass citizens The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism areas in which he had previously received criticism Prior to the election Modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign the BJP was able to shift this to a focus on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development although Hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media Modi's campaign blitz cost approximately ₹50 billion US720 million and received extensive financial support from corporate donors In addition to more conventional campaign methods Modi made extensive use of social media and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearancesThe BJP won 31 of the vote and more than doubled its tally in the Lok Sabha to 282 becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984 Voter dissatisfaction with the INC as well as with regional parties in North India was another reason for the success of the BJP as was the support from the RSS In states such as Uttar Pradesh in which the BJP performed well it drew exceptionally high support from uppercaste Hindus although the 10 percent of Muslim votes won was more than it had won before It performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the rightwing Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalismModi himself was a candidate for the Lok Sabha in two constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara He won in both constituencies defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi and Madhusudan Mistry of the INC in Vadodara by 570128 votes Modi who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP was appointed prime minister by India's president To comply with the law that an MP cannot represent more than one constituency he vacated the Vadodara seat

Gujarat lies 300400 km from the plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate but the current tectonics are still governed by the effects of the continuing continental collision along this boundary During the breakup of Gondwana in the Jurassic this area was affected by rifting with a roughly westeast trend During the collision with Eurasia the area has undergone shortening involving both reactivation of the original rift faults and development of new lowangle thrust faults The related folding has formed a series of ranges particularly in central KutchThe focal mechanism of most earthquakes is consistent with reverse faulting on reactivated rift faults The pattern of uplift and subsidence associated with the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake is consistent with reactivation of such a fault

From 1936 the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai as its governor under the nominal authority of the Republic of China central government According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama in the 1930s Ma Bufang had seized this northeast corner of Amdo in the name of Chiang Kaishek's weak government and incorporated it into the Chinese province of Qinghai Before going to Taktser Kewtsang had gone to Ma Bufang to pay his respects When Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser he had the family brought to him in Xining He first demanded proof that the boy was the Dalai Lama but the Lhasa government though informed by Kewtsang that this was the one told Kewtsang to say he had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates They knew that if he was declared to be the Dalai Lama the Chinese government would insist on sending a large army escort with him which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge Ma Bufang together with Kumbum Monastery then refused to allow him to depart unless he was declared to be the Dalai Lama but withdrew this demand in return for 100000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst them to let them go to Lhasa Kewtsang managed to raise this but the family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330000 dollars ransom one hundred thousand each for government officials the commanderinchief and the Kumbum Monastery twenty thousand for the escort and only ten thousand for Ma Bufang himself he saidTwo years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that the ransom had to be paid to avoid the Chinese getting involved and escorting him to Lhasa with a large army Meanwhile the boy was kept at Kumbum where two of his brothers were already studying as monks and recognised incarnate lamas The payment of 300000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa They paid Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed with interest in Lhasa The 20000dollar fee for an escort was dropped since the Muslim merchants invited them to join their caravan for protection Ma Bufang sent 20 of his soldiers with them and was paid from both sides since the Chinese government granted him another 50000 dollars for the expenses of the journey Furthermore the Indian government helped the Tibetans raise the ransom funds by affording them import concessionsReleased from Kumbum on 21 July 1939 the party travelled across Tibet in an epic journey to Lhasa in the large Muslim caravan with Lhamo Thondup now 4 years old riding with his brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules two years after being discovered As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Central Government of Tibet and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939 The ordination pabbajja and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were handled by Reting Rinpoche There was very limited Chinese involvement at this timeTibetan Buddhists normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu WishFulfilling Gem Kyabgon Saviour or just Kundun Presence His devotees as well as much of the Western world often call him His Holiness the Dalai Lama the style employed on the Dalai Lama's website According to the Dalai Lama he had a succession of tutors in Tibet including Reting Rinpoche Tathag Rinpoche Ling Rinpoche and lastly Trijang Rinpoche who became junior tutor when he was nineteen At the age of 11 he met the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer who became his videographer and tutor about the world outside Lhasa The two remained friends until Harrer's death in 2006In 1959 at the age of 23 he took his final examination at Lhasa's Jokhang Temple during the annual Monlam or Prayer Festival He passed with honours and was awarded the Lharampa degree the highestlevel geshe degree roughly equivalent to a doctorate in Buddhist philosophy

China claims that the Kuomintang government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and that a Kuomintang representative General Wu Zhongxin presided over the ceremony The British Representative Sir Basil Gould was also at the ceremony and bore witness to the falsity of the Chinese claim to have presided over it He criticised the Chinese account as follows

The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude Every one of these Chinese claims was false Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf as was done by the others including the British Representative But the Chinese have the ear of the world and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue Tibet has no newspapers either in English or Tibetan and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods

Giving public talks for nonBuddhist audiences and interviews and teaching Buddhism to large public audiences all over the world as well as to private groups at his residence in India appears to be the Dalai Lama's main activity Despite becoming 80 years old in 2015 he maintains a busy international lectures and teaching schedule His public talks and teachings are usually webcast live in multiple languages via an inviting organisation's website or on the Dalai Lama's own website Scores of his past teaching videos can be viewed there as well as public talks conferences interviews dialogues and panel discussionsThe Dalai Lama's best known teaching subject is the Kalachakra tantra which as of 2014 he had conferred a total of 33 times most often in India's upper Himalayan regions but also in western venues like Madison Square Garden in New York Los Angeles Washington DC Barcelona Graz Sydney and Toronto The Kalachakra Wheel of Time is one of the most complex teachings of Buddhism sometimes taking two weeks to confer and he often confers it on very large audiences up to 200000 students and disciples at a timeThe Dalai Lama is the author of numerous books on Buddhism many of them on general Buddhist subjects but also including books on particular topics like Dzogchen a Nyingma practice

In Dalai Lama's essay The Ethic of Compassion 1999 he expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with which cannot allow us to cultivate love He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strengthHe frequently accepts requests from students to visit various countries worldwide in order to give teachings to large Buddhist audiences teachings that are usually based on classical Buddhist texts and commentaries and most often those written by the 17 pandits or great masters of the Nalanda tradition such as Nagarjuna Kamalashila Shantideva Atisha Ayradeva and so on

The Dalai Lama refers to himself as a follower of these Nalanda masters in fact he often asserts that 'Tibetan Buddhism' is based on the Buddhist tradition of Nalanda monastery in ancient India since the texts written by those 17 Nalanda pandits or masters to whom he has composed a poem of invocation were brought to Tibet and translated into Tibetan when Buddhism was first established there and have remained central to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism ever sinceAs examples of other teachings in London in 1984 he was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising and on Dzogchen which he gave at Camden Town Hall in 1988 he was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general called 'A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism' Again in London in 1996 he taught the Four Noble Truths the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UKIn India the Dalai Lama gives religious teachings and talks in Dharamsala and numerous other locations including the monasteries in the Tibetan refugee settlements in response to specific requests from Tibetan monastic institutions Indian academic religious and business associations groups of students and individualprivatelay devotees In India no fees are charged to attend these teachings since costs are covered by requesting sponsors When he travels abroad to give teachings there is usually a ticket fee calculated by the inviting organization to cover the costs involved and any surplus is normally to be donated to recognised charitiesOn his frequent tours of India Asia and the west he is also often invited to give alongside his Buddhist teachings public talks for nonBuddhist audiences His talks and teaching activities in the US for example have included the following on his April 2008 US tour he gave lectures at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor at Rutgers University New Jersey and Colgate University New York Later in July the Dalai Lama gave a public lecture and conducted a series of teachings at Lehigh University Pennsylvania On 8 May 2011 the University of Minnesota bestowed upon him their highest award an Honorary Doctor of Letters and during a return trip to Minnesota on 2 March 2014 he spoke at Macalester College which awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degreeDozens of videos of recorded webcasts of the Dalai Lama's public talks on general subjects for nonBuddhists like peace happiness and compassion modern ethics the environment economic and social issues gender the empowerment of women and so forth can be viewed in his office's archive

The events in Gujarat were the first instance of communal violence in India in the age of 24hour news coverage and were televised worldwide This coverage played a central role in the politics of the situation Media coverage was generally critical of the Hindu right however the BJP portrayed the coverage as an assault on the honor of Gujaratis and turned the hostility into an emotive part of their electoral campaign With the violence receding in April a peace meeting was arranged at Sabarmati Ashram a former home of Mahatma Gandhi Hindutva supporters and police officers attacked almost a dozen journalists The state government banned television news channels critical of the government's response and local stations were blocked Two reporters working for STAR News were assaulted several times while covering the violence On a return trip from having interviewed Modi when their car was surrounded by a crowd one of the crowd claimed that they would be killed should they be a member of a minority community

The Editors Guild of India in its report on media ethics and coverage on the incidents stated that the news coverage was exemplary with only a few minor lapses The local newspapers Sandesh and Gujarat Samachar however were heavily criticised The report states that Sandesh had headlines which would provoke communalize and terrorize people The newspaper also used a quote from a VHP leader as a headline Avenge with blood The report stated that Gujarat Samachar had played a role in increasing the tensions but did not give all of its coverage over to hawkish and inflammatory reportage in the first few weeks The paper carried reports to highlight communal harmony Gujarat Today was given praise for showing restraint and for the balanced reportage of the violence Critical reporting on the Gujarat government's handling of the situation helped bring about the Indian government's intervention in controlling the violence The Editors Guild rejected the charge that graphic news coverage aggravated the situation saying that the coverage exposed the horrors of the riots as well as the supine if not complicit attitude of the state helping to propel remedial action

Many scholars and commentators have accused the state government of being complicit in the attacks either in failing to exert any effort to quell the violence or for actively planning and executing the attacks themselves The United States Department of State ultimately banned Narendra Modi from travelling to the United States due to his alleged role in the attacks These allegations center around several facts First the state did little to quell the violence with attacks continuing well through the Spring  Further some attackers used voter lists and other documents obtainable only with government assistance in order to target Muslim communities and households  Moreover the Vishva Hindu Parishad VHP as well as many politicians including Modi made inflammatory remarks and endorsed the statewide bandh further stoking tensions The historian Gyanendra Pandey described these attacks as state terrorism saying that they were not riots but organized political massacres According to Paul Brass the only conclusion from the evidence which is available points to a methodical AntiMuslim pogrom which was carried out with exceptional brutality coordinationThe media has described the attacks as state terrorism rather than communal riots due to the lack of state intervention  Many politicians downplayed the incidents claiming that the situation was under control  One minister who spoke with Rediffcom stated that though the circumstances were tense in Baroda and Ahmedabad the situation was under control and that the police who had been deployed were enough to prevent any violence The deputy superintendent of police stated that the Rapid Action Force had been deployed to sensitive areas in Godhra Gordhan Zadafia the Minister of State for Home stated that he believed there would be no retaliation from the Hindu community Once troops were airlifted in on 1 March Modi stated that the violence was no longer as intense as it had been and that it would soon be brought under control The violence continued for 3 months with no intervention from the federal government till May Local and statelevel politicians were seen leading violent mobs restraining the police and arranging the distribution of weapons leading investigative reports to conclude that the violence was engineered and launchedThroughout the violence attacks were made in full view of police stations and police officers who did not intervene In many instances police joined the mobs in perpetrating violence At one Muslim locality of the twentynine deaths sixteen were caused by police firing into the locality Some rioters even had printouts of voter registration lists allowing them to selectively target Muslim properties Selective targeting of properties was shown by the destruction of the offices of the Muslim Wakf board which was located within the confines of the high security zone and just 500 meters from the office of the chief ministerAccording to Scott W Hibbard the violence had been planned far in advance and that similar to other instances of communal violence the Bajrang Dal the VHP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS all took part in the attacks Following the attack on the train the VHP called for a statewide bandh strike and the state took no action to prevent thisThe Concerned Citizens Tribunal CCT report includes testimony of the then Gujarat BJP minister Haren Pandya since murdered who testified about an evening meeting convened by Modi the evening of the train burning At this meeting officials were instructed not to obstruct the Hindu rage following the incident The report also highlighted a second meeting held in Lunawada village of Panchmahal district attended by state ministers Ashok Bhatt and Prabhatsinh Chauhan among other BJP and RSS leaders where detailed plans were made on the use of kerosene and petrol for arson and other methods of killing The Jamiat UlamaiHind claimed in 2002 that some regional Congress workers collaborated with the perpetrators of the violenceDipankar Gupta believes that the state and police were clearly complicit in the violence but that some officers were outstanding in the performance of their duties such as Himanshu Bhatt and Rahul Sharma Sharma was reported to have said I don't think any other job would have allowed me to save so many lives  Human Rights Watch has reported on acts of exceptional heroism by Hindus Dalits and tribals who tried to protect Muslims from the violenceIn response to allegations of state involvement Gujarat government spokesman Bharat Pandya told the BBC that the rioting was a spontaneous Hindu backlash fueled by widespread anger against Muslims He said Hindus are frustrated over the role of Muslims in the ongoing violence in Indianadministered Kashmir and other parts of India  In support of this the US Ambassador atlarge for International Religious Freedom John Hanford expressed concern over religious intolerance in Indian politics and said that while the rioters may have been aided by state and local officials he did not believe that the BJPled central government was involved in inciting the riots

The Dalai Lama's lifelong interest in science and technology dates from his childhood in Lhasa Tibet when he was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks watches telescopes film projectors clockwork soldiers and motor cars and loved to repair disassemble and reassemble them Once observing the moon through a telescope as a child he realised it was a craterpocked lump of rock and not a heavenly body emitting its own light as Tibetan cosmologists had taught him He has also said that had he not been brought up as a monk he would probably have been an engineer On his first trip to the west in 1973 he asked to visit Cambridge University's astrophysics department in the UK and he sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper David Bohm and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who taught him the basics of science

The Dalai Lama sees important common ground between science and Buddhism in having the same approach to challenge dogma on the basis of empirical evidence that comes from observation and analysis of phenomenaHis growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the Buddhism and science interface led to invitations for him to attend relevant conferences on his visits to the west including the Alpbach Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where he met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J Varela Also in 1983 the American social entrepreneur and innovator R Adam Engle who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science was already considering the idea of facilitating for him a serious dialogue with a selection of appropriate scientists In 1984 Engle formally offered to the Dalai Lama's office to organise a weeklong formal dialogue for him with a suitable team of scientists provided that the Dalai Lama would wish to fully participate in such a dialogue Within 48 hours the Dalai Lama confirmed to Engle that he was truly interested in participating in something substantial about science so Engle proceeded with launching the project Francisco Varela having heard about Engle's proposal then called him to tell him of his earlier discussions with the Dalai Lama and to offer his scientific collaboration to the project Engle accepted and Varela assisted him to assemble his team of six specialist scientists for the first 'Mind and Life' dialogue on the cognitive sciences which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987 This fiveday event was so successful that at the end the Dalai Lama told Engle he would very much like to repeat it again in the future Engle then started work on arranging a second dialogue this time with neuroscientists in California and the discussions from the first event were edited and published as Mind and Life's first book Gentle Bridges Conversations with the Dalai Lama on the Sciences of MindAs Mind and Life Institute's remit expanded Engle formalised the organisation as a nonprofit foundation after the third dialogue held in 1990 which initiated the undertaking of neurobiological research programmes in the United States under scientific conditions Over the ensuing decades as of 2014 at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various worldrenowned scientists have followed held in various countries and covering diverse themes from the nature of consciousness to cosmology and from quantum mechanics to the neuroplasticity of the brain Sponsors and partners in these dialogues have included the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Johns Hopkins University the Mayo Clinic and Zurich UniversityApart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers the Dalai Lama has probably spent and continues to spend more of his time and resources investigating the interface between Buddhism and science through the ongoing series of Mind and Life dialogues and its spinoffs than on any other single activity As the Institute's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues which continue to expand worldwideThese activities have given rise to dozens of DVD sets of the dialogues and books he has authored on them such as Ethics for the New Millennium and The Universe in a Single Atom as well as scientific papers and university research programmes On the Tibetan and Buddhist side science subjects have been added to the curriculum for Tibetan monastic educational institutions and scholarship On the Western side university and research programmes initiated by these dialogues and funded with millions of dollars in grants from the Dalai Lama Trust include the EmoryTibet Partnership Stanford School of Medicine's Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education CCARES and the Centre for Investigating Healthy Minds amongst others

Of all the modern economic theories the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability Marxism is concerned with the distribution of wealth on an equal basis and the equitable utilisation of the means of production It is also concerned with the fate of the working classesthat is the majorityas well as with the fate of those who are underprivileged and in need and Marxism cares about the victims of minorityimposed exploitation For those reasons the system appeals to me and it seems fair I just recently read an article in a paper where His Holiness the Pope also pointed out some positive aspects of Marxism

A monk since childhood the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later while chastity offers a better life and more independence more freedom He has observed that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adulteryIn his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior he explains the concept of right organ in the right object at the right time which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral manual and anal sex both homosexual and heterosexual are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists However he also says that in modern times all common consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are gay or transgender from a secular point of view In a 1994 interview with OUT Magazine the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying If someone comes to me and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion' If you both agree then I think I would say 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others then it is okay' However when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor Evan Solomon on CBC News Sunday about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism the Dalai Lama responded that it is sexual misconduct This was an echo of an earlier response in a 2004 The Vancouver Sun interview when asked about homosexuality in Buddhism where the Dalai Lama replied for a Buddhist the same sex that is sexual misconductIn his 1996 book Beyond Dogma he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else     Homosexuality whether it is between men or between women is not improper in itself What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact He elaborated in 1997 explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him He also conveyed his own willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic contextThe Dalai Lama has expressed concern at reports of violence and discrimination against gay bisexual and transgender people and urges respect tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all

Congress President Sonia Gandhi surprised observers by declining to become the new prime minister instead asking former Finance Minister Manmohan Singh a respected economist to head the new government Singh had previously served in the Congress government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the early 1990s where he was seen as one of the architects of India's first economic liberalisation plan which staved off an impending national monetary crisis Despite the fact that Singh had never won a Lok Sabha seat his considerable goodwill and Sonia Gandhi's nomination won him the support of the UPA allies and the Left Front

Newspaper clippings about  14th Dalai Lama in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBWThe 1828 United States presidential election was the 11th quadrennial presidential election held from October 31 to December 2 1828 It featured a rematch of the 1824 election as President John Quincy Adams of the National Republican Party faced Andrew Jackson of the Democratic Party Both parties were new organizations and this was the first Presidential election their nominees contested Unlike in 1824 Jackson defeated Adams marking the start of Democratic dominance in Federal politics

In 1824 with four major candidates running for President as members of only one national party Jackson had won a plurality both of the electoral vote and of the popular vote from among the 18 states whose voters chose Presidential electors  However with the open support of House Speaker Henry Clay Adams won the subsequent contingent election in the House of Representatives under the Twelfth Amendment  Many Jackson supporters perceived that his loss though Constitutional was unfair and contrary to the popular will accusing Adams and Clay of having reached a corrupt bargain in which Clay helped Adams win the contingent election in return for the position of Secretary of State Intensifying political rivalry between supporters and opponents of Jackson fractured the oncedominant DemocraticRepublican Party Jackson and allies such as Martin Van Buren and Vice President John C Calhoun laid the foundations of the Democratic Party while supporters of Adams and other Jackson opponents rallied around the President calling themselves National Republicans

By popular pressure states had recently expanded voting rights to nearly all white men in nearly all elections For example in 1824 state legislatures chose Presidential electors in six states but by 1828 four had transitioned to voter choice Also while nationally organized parties had fielded rival candidates before 1828 was the first election in which broadly qualified voters effectively chose the President from between nominees of two national parties whose candidates or electors consistently appeared on all ballots With greater perceived and real impact voter participation grew with 95 of Americans casting a vote for President compared with 34 in 1824Jackson was aided by the passage of the Tariff of 1828 which raised tariffs Denounced by opponents as the Tariff of Abominations the unpopular tariff and the greater charisma and popular appeal of Jackson helped him dominate the South and West Adams swept New England but won only three other small states Jackson became the first President whose home state was neither Massachusetts nor Virginia while Adams was the second to lose reelection following his father John Adams The election marked the rise of Jacksonian Democracy and the transition from the First Party System to the Second Party System Historians debate the significance of the election with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics by removing key barriers to voter participation and establishing a stable twoparty system

Andrew Jackson won a plurality of electoral votes in the election of 1824 but still lost to John Quincy Adams when the election was deferred to the House of Representatives by the terms of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution a presidential election in which no candidate wins a majority of the electoral vote is decided by the House of Representatives Henry Clay unsuccessful candidate and Speaker of the House at the time despised Jackson in part due to their fight for Western votes during the election and he chose to support Adams which led to Adams being elected president A few days after the election Adams named Clay his Secretary of State a position which at that time often led to the presidency Jackson and his followers immediately accused Clay and Adams of striking a corrupt bargain and they continued to lambaste the president until the 1828 election

Within months after the inauguration of John Quincy Adams in 1825 the Tennessee legislature renominated Jackson for president thus setting the stage for a rematch between these two very different politicians three years thence Congressional opponents of Adams including former William H Crawford supporter Martin Van Buren rallied around Jackson's candidacy Jackson's supporters called themselves Democrats and would formally organize as the Democratic Party shortly after his election In hopes of uniting those opposed to Adams Jackson ran on a ticket with sitting Vice President John C Calhoun Calhoun would decline the invitation to join the Democratic Party however and instead formed the Nullifier Party after the election the Nullifiers would remain largely aligned with the Democrats for the next few years but ultimately broke with Jackson over the issue of states' rights during his first term No congressional nominating caucus or national convention was held

The campaign was marked by large amounts of nasty mudslinging Jackson's marriage for example came in for vicious attack When Jackson married his wife Rachel in 1791 the couple believed that she was divorced however the divorce was not yet finalized so he had to remarry her once the legal papers were complete In the Adams campaign's hands this became a scandal Charles Hammond in his Cincinnati Gazette asked Ought a convicted adulteress and her paramour husband be placed in the highest offices of this free and Christian land Jackson also came under heavy attack as a slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of modern standards of morality he was not attacked for merely owning slaves used in plantation work The Coffin Handbills attacked Jackson for his courtsmartial execution of deserters and massacres of Indian villages and also his habit of dueling
==========
==========
==========
Jackson avoided articulating issue positions instead campaigning on his personal qualities and his opposition to Adams Adams avoided popular campaigning instead emphasizing his support of specific issues Adams's praise of internal improvements in Europe such as lighthouses of the skies observatories in his first annual message to Congress and his suggestion that Congress not be palsied by the will of our constituents were given attention in and out of the press John Randolph stated on the floor of the Senate that he never will be palsied by any power save the constitution and the will of my constituents Jackson wrote that a lavish government combined with contempt of the constituents could lead to despotism if not checked by the voice of the people

Though prepoll predictions were for an overwhelming majority for the BJP the exit polls immediately after the elections and before the counting began predicted a hung parliament However even the exit polls could only indicate the general trend and nowhere close to the final figures There is also the general perception that as soon as the BJP started realising that events might not proceed entirely in its favour it changed the focus of its campaign from India Shining to issues of stability The Congress who was regarded as oldfashioned by the ruling BJP was largely backed by poor rural lowercaste and minority voters that did not participate in the economic boom of previous years that created a large wealthy middle class and thus achieved its overwhelming victory Another reason which was not mentioned much but still spoken of in the public was that BJP supporters are workingclass people and the poll surveys predicted BJP win and therefore they did not reach the ballot Whereas the Congress support base the weaker sections of the society don't miss voting at allAnother more prominent reason came from checking the RSS contribution RSS cadres reached Vajpayee over the killing of 4 RSS workers in Assam and Vajpayee disappointed them RSS backed off and results were evident

Thomas Jefferson wrote favorably in response to Jackson in December 1823 and extended an invitation to his estate of Monticello I recall with pleasure the remembrance of our joint labors while in the Senate together in times of great trial and of hard battling battles indeed of words not of blood as those you have since fought so much for your own glory  that of your country with the assurance that my attempts continue undiminished accept that of my great respect  considerationJefferson wrote in dismay at the outcome of the contingent election of 1825 to Congressional caucus nominee William H Crawford saying that he had hoped to congratulate Crawford but events had not been what we had wishedIn the next election Jackson's and Adams's supporters saw value in establishing the opinion of Jefferson in regards to their respective candidates and against their opposition Jefferson died on July 4 1826
==========
It is also believed that voters regardless of which country they are in are enthused by negative messages and are indifferent to positive messages
==========
A goal of the proAdams press was to depict Jackson as a mere military chieftain Edward Coles recounted that Jefferson told him in a conversation in August 1825 that he feared the popular enthusiasm for Jackson It has caused me to doubt more than anything that has occurred since our Revolution Coles used the opinion of Thomas Gilmer to back himself up Gilmer said Jefferson told him at Monticello before the election of Adams in 1825 One might as well make a sailor of a cock or a soldier of a goose as a President of Andrew Jackson Daniel Webster who was also at Monticello at the time made the same report Webster recorded that Jefferson told him in December 1824 that Jackson was a dangerous man unfit for the presidency Historian Sean Wilentz described Webster's account of the meeting as not wholly reliable Biographer Robert V Remini said that Jefferson had no great love for Jackson
==========
It is generally believed that RSS plays an important role in mobilising the BJP supporters the results were not for the win for Congress led UPA but more for the defeat of BJP led NDA And the reason was that RSS did not mobilise the voters and BJP cadres
==========

==========

==========
Gilmer accused Coles of misrepresentation for Jefferson's opinion had changed Gilmer said Jefferson's soninlaw former Virginia Governor Thomas Mann Randolph Jr said in 1826 that Jefferson had a strong repugnance to Henry Clay Randolph publicly stated that Jefferson became friendly to Jackson's candidacy as early as the summer of 1825 perhaps because of the corrupt bargain charge and thought of Jackson as an honest sincere clearheaded and strongminded man of the soundest political principles and the only hope left to reverse the increasing powers assumed by the federal government Others said the same thing but Coles could not believe Jefferson's opinion had changedIn 1827 Virginia Governor William B Giles released a letter from Jefferson meant to be kept private to Thomas Ritchie's Richmond Enquirer It was written after Adams's first annual message to Congress and it contained an attack from Jefferson on the incumbent administration Giles said Jefferson's alarm was with the usurpation of the rights of the states not with a military chieftain Jefferson wrote take together the decisions of the federal court the doctrines of the President and the misconstructions of the constitutional compact acted on by the legislature of the federal bench and it is but too evident that the three ruling branches of that department are in combination to strip their colleagues the State authorities of the powers reserved by them and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic Of the Federalists he continued But this opens with a vast accession of strength from their younger recruits who having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of '76 now look to a single and splendid government of an aristocracy founded on banking institutions and moneyed incorporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures commerce and navigation riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry The Jacksonians and states' rights men heralded its publication the Adams men felt it a symptom of senility Giles omitted a prior letter of Jefferson's praise of Adams for his role in the embargo of 1808 Thomas Jefferson Randolph soon collected and published Jefferson's correspondence

The selection of electors began on October 31 with elections in Ohio and Pennsylvania and ended on November 13 with elections in North Carolina The Electoral College met on December 3 Adams won almost exactly the same states that his father had won in the election of 1800 the New England states New Jersey and Delaware In addition Adams picked up Maryland Jackson won everything else which resulted in a landslide victory for him
